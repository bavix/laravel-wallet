- Transaction support.
- Now, within the transaction, the wallet has its own balance state.

### Fixed
- Fixed unit tests with checking for transaction level (mariadb).

### Updated

### Removed
- class `WalletServiceLegacy`
- method `CommonServiceLegacy::addBalance`

## [7.0.0] - 2021-11-25
### Updated
- Optimization of the `payFreeCart` and `payFree` request. Now the package does not update the repository. But there is no point in updating it, because the client does not pay anything.
- Now everything is in contracts. It became easier for you to modify the package to suit your needs.
- Updated package core. If you are tied to the kernel, then you will have to rewrite some code.
- Optimized the algorithm for transfers and purchases. When paying for a large basket, the productivity increase at the peak is up to 24 times.
- If a batch of transactions does not change the balance, then the accounting service will not update the wallet balance.

### Fixed
- Fixed issues with postgres. There was a bug when working with currencies, for some reason the request sometimes dropped and went into a deadlock.

### Added
- Added `uuid` column to the wallet table.
- Added `phpstan`, `psalm`, `deptrac`, `rector`. The package update should now be smoother and with fewer bugs.
