## 7.1.0 - 2021-12-05

### Added
- Transaction support.
- Now, within the transaction, the wallet has its own balance state.

### Fixed
- Fixed unit tests with checking for transaction level (mariadb).

### Updated
- Due to the state within transactions, I was able to speed up the computation up to 25 times for complex transfers.

### Removed
- class `WalletServiceLegacy`
- method `CommonServiceLegacy::addBalance`

## What's Changed
* [7.1] Transaction State by [@rez1dent3](https://github.com/rez1dent3) in https://github.com/bavix/laravel-wallet/pull/412


**Full Changelog**: https://github.com/bavix/laravel-wallet/compare/7.0.0...7.1.0

## 7.0.0 - 2021-11-25

### Updated
- Optimization of the `payFreeCart` and `payFree` request. Now the package does not update the repository. But there is no point in updating it, because the client does not pay anything.
- Now everything is in contracts. It became easier for you to modify the package to suit your needs.
- Updated package core. If you are tied to the kernel, then you will have to rewrite some code.
- Optimized the algorithm for transfers and purchases. When paying for a large basket, the productivity increase at the peak is up to 24 times.
- If a batch of transactions does not change the balance, then the accounting service will not update the wallet balance.

### Fixed
- Fixed issues with postgres. There was a bug when working with currencies, for some reason the request sometimes dropped and went into a deadlock.

### Added
- Added `uuid` column to the wallet table.
- Added `phpstan`, `psalm`, `deptrac`, `rector`. The package update should now be smoother and with fewer bugs.

### Renamed
- rename `CommonService` to `CommonServiceLegacy`
- rename `MetaService` to `MetaServiceLegacy`
- rename `WalletService` to `WalletServiceLegacy`

### Deprecated
- class `CommonServiceLegacy`

**Full Changelog**: https://github.com/bavix/laravel-wallet/compare/5.5.0...5.5.1

## 6.0.0 - 2020-11-13

### Added
- Bigger and safer. There are never many tests. As always, new test cases have been added.
- Package `brick/math` is now required.
- Added examples of integrations with the `cknow/laravel-money` package in unit tests.
- The `Storable` interface has an additional method `fresh` to clean up all data.
- Added psalm, but not used yet.
- Added phpmetrics, thanks to which it was possible to remove a lot of loops in the code.
- Added meta column in wallet, now the package is more extensible. I moved currency from the config to the meta.
- Added an icon to the documentation.
- Added full support for php 8. We are waiting for the release.
- Added `adjustment` method, it deals with balance adjustment. In automatic mode, it calculates the difference between the current amount on the balance sheet and for transactions, and if the balance does not converge, then finishes with a transaction.
- Added the ability to initialize the default wallet with the required meta parameters (needed to work with currencies).
- Added method `negative` to `Mathable` interface.

### Changed
- Now the package works exclusively with strings, there are fewer problems when working with large numbers.
- Now, to work with cryptocurrencies, it is not necessary to install `bcmath`.
- JS documentation is no longer dependent on CDN, everything is collected in one bundle.
- Updated the command to refresh the balance, now without a transaction for all wallets. Use carefully.
- Currencies are now in "wallets.meta.currency", please do not use the config for these cases.
- English documentation has been slightly improved.
- Updated phpunit to support php 8.

### Removed
- Removed php 7.2 support.
- Drop package `laravel/legacy-factories`.
- Remove `BCMath` and `Math` classes.

### Fixed
- Fixed a bug when withdrawing large funds from the wallet. Sometimes the number went beyond int64 and the exception fell on "negative number".

### Deprecated
- The key in the currencies config will be removed in 7.x. Use "wallet.meta.currency".
