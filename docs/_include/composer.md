## Composer

The recommended installation method is using [Composer](https://getcomposer.org/).

In your project root just run:

```bash
composer req bavix/laravel-wallet
```

Ensure that you’ve set up your project to [autoload Composer-installed packages](https://getcomposer.org/doc/01-basic-usage.md#autoloading).
